# gh-find-code-mcp
An mcp server to find code on github.

## Motivation
Even in the world of code generation it is cheaper to find something than make it. Searching the web for projects - which seems to be what claude code does out of the box seems silly. This is a little wrapper around gh to do the searching.

The value is going to be in the projects here.


## Installation
pipx install gh-find-code-mcp

## Usage
Add gh-find-code-mcp as an MCP server with pipes.
